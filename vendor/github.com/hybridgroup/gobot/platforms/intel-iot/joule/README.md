The Intel Joule is a wifi and BluetoothÂ® enabled development platform for the Internet of Things.

## Setting up your Intel Joule

Everything you need to get started with the Joule is in the Intel Getting Started Guide located at:

https://intel.com/joule/getstarted

Don't forget to configure your Joule's wifi connection and update your Joule to the latest firmware image!

## Example program

Save the following code into a file called `main.go`.

```go
package main

import (
	"time"

	"github.com/hybridgroup/gobot"
	"github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/gpio"
	"github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/intel-iot/joule"
)

func main() {
	gbot := gobot.NewGobot()

	e := joule.NewJouleAdaptor("joule")
	led := gpio.NewLedDriver(e, "led", "103")

	work := func() {
		gobot.Every(1*time.Second, func() {
			led.Toggle()
		})
	}

	robot := gobot.NewRobot("blinkBot",
		[]gobot.Connection{e},
		[]gobot.Device{led},
		work,
	)

	gbot.AddRobot(robot)

	gbot.Start()
}
```

You can read the [full API documentation online](http://godoc.org/github.com/hybridgroup/gobot).

#### Cross compiling for the Intel Joule

Compile your Gobot program run the following command using the command
line from the directory where you have your `main.go` file:

```bash
$ GOARCH=386 GOOS=linux go build .
```

Then you can simply upload your program over the network from your host computer to the Joule

```bash
$ scp main root@<IP of your device>:/home/root/blink
```

and then execute it on your Joule (use screen to connect, see the Intel
setup steps if you don't recall how to connect)

```bash
$ ./blink
```

At this point you should see one of the onboard LEDs blinking. Press control + c
to exit.

To update the program after you made a change, you will need to scp it
over once again and start it from the command line (via screen).

## Pin Mapping

The Gobot pin mapping for the Intel Joule uses the same numbering as the MRAA library does, as documented here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/pin-mapping-for-carrier-board-joule

Of special note are the pins that control the build-in LEDs, which are pins 100 thru 103, as used in the example above.

The i2c interfaces on the Intel Joule developer kit board require that you terminate the SDA & SCL lines using 2 10K resistors pulled up to the voltage used for the i2c device, for example 5V.
